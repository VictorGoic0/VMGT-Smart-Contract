# Product Context: VMGToken ERC-20 Token

## Why This Project Exists

Building an ERC-20 token contract provides tangible portfolio evidence of smart contract development skills. This project demonstrates:

- Practical Solidity development experience
- Understanding of Ethereum blockchain fundamentals
- Ability to deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Knowledge of token standards and best practices
- Professional deployment and documentation capabilities

## Problems It Solves

1. **Portfolio Demonstration**: Provides concrete evidence of blockchain development skills
2. **Learning Platform**: Hands-on experience with smart contract development lifecycle
3. **Standard Implementation**: Demonstrates understanding of ERC-20 token standard
4. **Deployment Experience**: Real-world experience with testnet and mainnet deployments

## How It Should Work

### User Experience (Token Holders)
- View token balance in MetaMask wallet
- Transfer tokens to other addresses
- Approve spending allowances for DApps
- Receive tokens from other addresses
- Interact with token via Etherscan interface

### Developer Experience
- Deploy contracts using Hardhat framework
- Write and run comprehensive unit tests
- Verify contracts on Etherscan
- Monitor deployments and transactions
- Document all versions and features

### Owner Experience (Contract Owner)
- Mint additional tokens (V1+)
- Burn tokens to reduce supply (V1+)
- Pause/unpause transfers in emergencies (V1+)
- Set transfer tax rate and recipient (V2+)
- Lock tokens for specific addresses (V2+)

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Standard ERC-20 interface familiar to all wallet users
2. **Transparency**: All transactions visible on blockchain explorers
3. **Security**: OpenZeppelin audited contracts for safety
4. **Flexibility**: Progressive feature additions across versions
5. **Documentation**: Clear instructions for all interactions

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Portfolio reviewers (potential employers like BNY Mellon)
- **Secondary**: Blockchain developers learning from the project
- **Tertiary**: Token holders using the deployed contract
